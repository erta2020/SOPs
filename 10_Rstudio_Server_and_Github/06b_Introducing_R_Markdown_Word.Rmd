## Using this Document

This document provides both an explanation and example of the Markdown language and it's use in R Studio. The .Rmd file is the file that I have created that demonstrates Markdown and explains how it works. 

At some point in the learning process, I suggest you save this document with a new name in your own directory and then **Knit** it to make sure it all works okay. If these instructions are already over your head, no worries. Just read along and you will start to understand this goal as you move through the document.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document to help students use R Markdown to write Microsoft Word Documents. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. The R Markdown language has been implemented in R studio so we can use R functions and arguments to create word documents that include data analysis in a seemless way. 

There are, of course, dozens of ways we can intregrate data analysis and text but for our purposes, we will use this method because it is 1) pretty simple to learn, 2) freely avaiable, and 3) generates consistent results (and errors!). 


### Implementing R Markdown in R Studio

When opening a new document, select File/New/Markdown and you will be given a template that looks much like this. After you have saved the file in your Rstudio directory, you can **Knit** the document to create the word document. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. This will create a word document and you will (usually?) be prompted to save the file on your local computer. Once on your computer you can make additional edits. 

**NOTE:** When you make edits on your desktop's word document, these changes will be losts if you **Knit** the document again with the same name. I recommend that you give the file a new name or try to limit your edits to the .Rmd file. 

## Some Simple Syntax / Format Codes

### Setting up the Document

At the beginning of the document is a section that defines the title, author, date and type of output (which can include more than one, e.g. html, pdf and/or word). Following this is a short R code chunk to set up some options. For now we don't need to know what these mean, although you are welcome to look it up if you are interested.

### Creating Formated Text to Structure the DocumentFinally, you can start the actual text. 

### Creating Titles and Headers

Using double hatch tags or pound symbols, Markdown will generate headers -- #, ##, ###, and #### all legitimate headers, where they can be nested:

# First Header

## Second level

FYI: I use this more often because the top header generates a header that is often too big. 

### Third Level

#### Fourth Level


### Other kinds of formating

You can create italics, bold, and other types of font formats. We can create lists and tables as well. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Examples of Embedding R code chunks

### R Code Chunks -- Bounded by Accent Marks
R Code Chunks begin with three accent marks (these are not the same as a single quote mark, notice they are slated in the opposite direction as a quotation mark. After the accent marks, we use a curly brack followed by the letter r. If you want to identify the code chunk you can put a reference name of the chunk afterwards, but it's not required. Finally, you end the openning R Code Chunk with a closing curly bracket. Then, you can add the R code. After the R code is complete, you can end the r code and return to the text with three accent marks. 

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

The R chunk above has a reference name of "cars", which helps you keep track of the R chunks. Keeping track of R chunks might sound trival now, but later on, it's going to be quite helpful when you increasingly complicated files, i.e. text and R chunks. 

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pressure2 <- pressure
plot(x = pressure2$temperature, y= pressure2$pressure, xlab="Temperature (C)", ylab="Pressure (psi)", las=1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Lots of options

There numerous options available to improve the output files, but these are quite advanced topics. However, during the semester, I may add the most common to this document so this resource will continue to improve.
