## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

The R chunk above has a reference name of "cars", which helps you keep track of the R chunks. Keeping track of R chunks might sound trival now, but later on, it's going to be quite helpful when you increasingly complicated files, i.e. text and R chunks. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pressure2 <- pressure
plot(x = pressure2$temperature, y= pressure2$pressure, xlab="Temperature (C)", ylab="Pressure (psi)", las=1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
