\section{Scope and Application}

\NP This method will train researchers in how to safely and correctly operate the multiparameter pH meter (Accumet XL 600) to accurately determine the pH, DO (dissolved oxygen), Conductivity, and BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) of water samples. 

\NP This method also includes detailed instruction in how to calibrate and and take care of the meter to ensure the best results and most accurate results

\section{Biases and Interferences}

\NP Biases and interferences can come from...

\section{Health and Safety}

\NP Chemical reagents and or samples to be analyzed by the pH meter may cause irritation if they come into contact with skin, noise or eyes

\NP Always be sure to read the material data safety sheets (MSDS) of the chemicals you will be working with in the lab and to wear appropriate lab safety equipment

\subsection{Safety and Personnnel Protective Equipment}

\NP Lab safety-glasses and lab coats are required for all laboritory analysis. Use gloves to avoid skin irritation from contact with acetone; work under fume hood when possible. 

\NP Waste Disposal-- Dispose of waste in the NON-ORGANIC waste collection bottle. Never place any acids or bases in See ''SOP 02 Handling of Hazardous Materials.'' %Figure out who and how this bottle will be disposed of properly. Most likely the Environmental Health and Safety Officer (Wang??) Ask Marc about what bottles he is planning to use to store organic and inorganic wastes.

\section{Personnel \& Training Responsibilities}

\NP Researchers training is required before this the procedures in this method can be used... 

\NP Researchers using this SOP should be trained for the following SOPs:

\begin{itemize}
  \item SOP01 Laboratory Safety
  \item SOP02 Field Safety
\end{itemize}
