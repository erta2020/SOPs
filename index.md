## Welcome to Environmental Analysis's SOP GitHub Pages.

This page provides a simple gateway to the Github site where all the SOPs are being developed. Most of the SOPs have been created as place holders with little content. The content is continuously being developed as a collaboration between student researchers, class teams, capstone students, research staff, and Professor Los Huertos
