LaTeX [some like to think] is  the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. \n\nNOTE: LaTeX is a typesetting system, not a word processor. LaTeX uses source code to generate a document: you edit one file and typeset it to a generate the output (usually PDF nowadays). This is in contrast to a word processor, where you edit the text as it appears\n\n### Why use LaTeX to create documents?\n\n## How to integrete R and LaTeX?\n\n\n\n## Github and Developing Repositories\n\n### The Daily Process:\n\nPull, edit files, save files, Commit, and Push\n\n\n",
