Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.\n\nWhen you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n```{r cars}\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\nThe R chunk above has a reference name of \"cars\", which helps you keep track of the R chunks. Keeping track of R chunks might sound trival now, but later on, it's going to be quite helpful when you increasingly complicated files, i.e. text and R chunks. \n\n## Including Plots\n\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}\npressure2 <- pressure\nplot(x = pressure2$temperature, y= pressure2$pressure, xlab=\"Temperature (C)\", ylab=\"Pressure (psi)\", las=1)\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n",
