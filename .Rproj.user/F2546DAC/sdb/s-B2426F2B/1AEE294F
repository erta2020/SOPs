One challenge to reduce risks is the development of training records that can track training efforts. \n\nThis form is used to track training in the Los Huertos lab. It is not a guareenttee that risks are no longer present, but that our lab has made a good effort to train all researchers and develop a laboratory where risks are better understood and strategies are in place to reduce these risks.\n\n\\section{Using this Document}\n\n\\subsection{Understanding SOPs}\n\nFor each procedure in the lab needed, researchers shall read and undersand the appropriate SOPs. \n\nAfter reading the researcher is responsible to communicate to the laboratory manager that they understand the intent, goals, and strategies of the SOP to reduce risks.\n\n\\subsection{Using Table \\ref{tab:Documentation}}\n\nAfter reading and disucssiong the SOP with the laboratory manager, sign and date that you have read the SOP. By signing the form, you have agreed to the following: \n\n\\begin{quote} \nI agree that I have been adequately trained to use (designated equipment). I understand all safety hazards and operating procedures, and if anything goes wrong, I know what to do. Any injuries or broken equipment that happen while I am in use of the machine will be my fault alone.\n\\end{quote}\n\nInitials: \\framebox(50,15)[]{}\n\n\\subsection{Obtaining the Laboratory Manager's Signature}\nOnce you have completed this, contact the laboratory manager to verify the training and discussion of the SOP. This stage may require further training and is complete only when she/he signs and dates this form at the appropriate boxes. \n\n\\subsection{Making the Form Available}\n\nOnce the form has been signed, place the form in the SOP Traning Binder in the Lab. \n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\t\\caption{SOP Traning Documentation}\n\t\\label{tab:Documentation}\n\t\t\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|p{4cm}|p{2cm}|p{4cm}|p{2cm}|}\\hline\nSOP No. & Version No. & Signature & Date  & Manager & Date \\\\\n\\hline\n1  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n2  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n3  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n4  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n5  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n6  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n  & & & & & \\\\ [1.2ex]\\hline\n\t\t\\end{tabular}\n\n\\end{table}\n\n\n\\end{document}",
