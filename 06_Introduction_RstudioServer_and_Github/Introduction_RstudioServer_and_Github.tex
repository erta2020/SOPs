\section{Introduction}
As students of the environment in this course, our ability to have substantive scienctific discourse rests upon our ability to draw meaningul conclusions from observations or data. In dealing with the problems of data, as in other sciences, we will utilize the language of statistics and mathematics to deal with the complexity of environmental issues. This enables us to draw on really powerful statistical and computational tools that have been developed to deal with data - in particular open source software like R, Rstudio and Git. \\
Once you get the hang of using these programs, you will be equipped to do many kinds of interesting and powerful analyses. However, becoming facile in using these programs can feel a lot like learning how to walk. We need to approach this process in descrete steps. The following pages will explain a little more about what Rstudio and Github are, as well as guide you through an excercise that connects the functionality of both programs!

  \subsection{Purpose}
  
This document is intended as a resource and guide to help you understand how to: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item How to create projects Rstudio and connect them with your peers so you can collaborate online using Github repositories. 
  \item How to troubleshoot when you run into problems "pushing", "pulling" and "merging" your work with your collaborators.
  \end{itemize}
\section{Background}

  \subsection{What is R?}
  % R is a powerful, open source program but combined with RStudio and Github the program becomes an archetype of a program that enables 1) collaboration, 2) transparency, and 3) accessibility.
  
  % RStudio is the user interface for R. Although R by itself is an amazing example of crowd sourcing, where a wide range of staticians and programmers have created a free programming environments with a robust range of statistical packages, the RStudio interface provides a user with the tools to track and publish their analysis process in an effecient and transparent way. 
  
  %Local Install versus Server --- R and RStudio can be installed on a local computer/laptop from the CRAN download mirror sites. However, we also have access to the R and RStudio Server installed on the Pomona College mainframe, where you can access it via a web browser. Wow, this is conveient!
  
  \subsection{What is Git and Github?}
  %GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service.
  % Version Control is a method to track changes in software, and often in the context of collaborative projects. The final component of R and RStudio is its capacity to create projects (RStudio's terminology) and repositories (Github's terminalogy) that can be shared among collaborators. In particular, the collaboration allows for contributions to be tracked via version control tools. There are a number of ways that we can access these tools, but we'll try to limit the methods to keep the process relatively ``simple''.
