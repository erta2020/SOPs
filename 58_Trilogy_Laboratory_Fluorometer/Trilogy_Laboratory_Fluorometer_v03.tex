\section{Scope and Application}

\NP The scope of this SOP is train researchers in the use of the Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer, a compact, multifunctional laboratory instrument that can be used for making fluoresence, absorbance, or turbidity measurements using the appropriate snap-in Optical Module. 

\NP The applications of this SOP are for...

\section{Summary of Method}

\NP The Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer is a compact, multifunctional laboratory insturment that can be used for making fluoresence, absorbance, and turbidity measurements using the appropriate snap-in Optical Module. A color touch screen with simple menus makes for an intuitive user interface.

\section{Modules}
\NP There are several different modules available to the Trilogy Laboratory Fluorometer:

\begin{itemize}
  \item 1. The Absorbance Module accepts interchangeable filter paddles so measurements can be made at different wavelenghts in order to identify or place a samplein a particular class of compounds. The standard filter paddle wavelengths/bandwidths are: 560/10; 600/10 and 750/10 nm.
  \item The Turbidity Module uses an Infrared (IR) LED with a wavelength of 850 nm as required for reference method: ISO 7027/DIN EN 27027, "Water Quality- Determination of Turbidity". Using Infrared allows Turbidity to be measured at wavelengths that are not normally absorbed by organic matter thereby reducing susceptibility to interference by sample color. 
\end{itemize}

\NP When properly calibrated, the Trilogy Fluorometer will read out the actual concentration of the solution. Optical Modules contain the necessary light source and filters for the relevant application.
