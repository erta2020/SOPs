\section{Scope and Application}

\NP The scope of this SOP covers how to operate the IRMS for certified users.

\NP The applications of this SOP are for the Thermo Scientific Delta V Serice IRMS. 

\section{Summary of Method}

\NP This SOP describes how to 1) prepare samples, 2) prepare instrument, 3) set up sequence, 4) run samples, 5) clean up samples; and 6) data reduction.

\section{Sample Preparation}

\NP Sample preparation will take place in the wet lab SGM Rm 133 and isotope analysis will take place at the David W. and Claire B. Oxtoby Environmental Isotope lab \url{https://sites.google.com/view/pomonaeageolabs/oxtoby-isotope-lab} (SGM Rm 135).

\NP Soil or sediment cores will be weighed into an aluminum crucible and oven-dried at 105\degree C

\NP Samples and standards are submitted to an elemental analysis (EA) to determine the elemental composition of carbon and nitrogen. 

\NP Amounts needed for the isotopic analyses are based on the results of the elemental analysis, an example calculator is found here: \url{http://stableisotopefacility.ucdavis.edu/sample-weight-calculator.html}

\NP Samples are weighed accordingly into tin capsules (~0.5 â€“ 20 mg) with 2 parts tungsten oxide (WO3).

\NP Calibrated internal standards are prepared as a reference for every batch of samples.


\NP Isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur are determined by the analysis of CO2 and N2, produced by combustion on a VarioEL III Elemental Analyzer followed by ``trap and purge`` separation and on-line analysis by continuous-flow with an Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (ThermoFisher Delta V Plus) with attached ThermoFisher GasBench, Flash IRMS EA and TC/EA.

\section{Prepare Sequence -- Isodat}

\NP Open the Acquisition tool of Isodat software and open a new file and select the sequence icon. 

\NP Define the number of samples. 

\NP Select the appropriate method. If you do not have a prepared method, contact the manager for assistance. 

\NP Make sure Peak Center has a green check mark

\NP Enter text to identify the sample in the ``Identifier 1'' column.

\NP Make sure each sample has a method, you can use an autofill function to accomplish this.

\section{Run Sequence}

\NP Click on the ``Start'' button.

\NP Enter a file name, where the extension .seq is added automatically. The file convention used in the lab is:

\medskip

YYYYMMDD\_Project\_SamplesIDs\_Username.seq
