## Define X and Y Boundaries

```{r}
rmarkdown::render("XY_RandomNumbers.Rmd", params = list(
  region = "west"
))
```



```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
