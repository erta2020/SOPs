## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document to help students use R Markdown to write Microsoft Word Documents. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. The R Markdown language has been implemented in R studio so we can use R functions and arguments to create word documents that include data analysis in a seemless way. 

There are, of course, dozens of ways we can intregrate data analysis and text but for our purposes, we will use this method because it is 1) pretty simple to learn, 2) freely avaiable, and 3) generates consistent results (and errors!). 

### Implementing R Markdown in R Studio

When opening a new document, select File/New/Markdown and you will be given a template that looks much like this. After you have saved the file in your Rstudio directory, you can **Knit** the document to create the word document. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. This will create a word document and you will (usually?) be prompted to save the file on your local computer. Once on your computer you can make additional edits. 

**NOTE:** When you make edits on your desktop's word document, these changes will be losts if you **Knit** the document again with the same name. I recommend that you give the file a new name or try to limit your edits to the .Rmd file. 

## Some Simple Syntax / Format Codes

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Examples of Embedding R code chunks

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

The R chunk above has a reference name of "cars", which helps you keep track of the R chunks. Keeping track of R chunks might sound trival now, but later on, it's going to be quite helpful when you increasingly complicated files, i.e. text and R chunks. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pressure2 <- pressure
plot(x = pressure2$temperature, y= pressure2$pressure, xlab="Temperature (C)", ylab="Pressure (psi)", las=1)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
