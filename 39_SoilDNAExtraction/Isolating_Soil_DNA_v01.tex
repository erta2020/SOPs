\section{DNA Extraction }

\NP The scope of this SOP is train researchers to become familiar with the steps and procedures involved in extracting genomic DNA from plant material, and in particular, algal species. With the use of equipment and materials provided in the Nucleospin Plant II Kit, DNA from plant samples can be successfully extracted by following proper protocol, safety precautions, and by paying close attention to the detailed instructions outlined in this handout, alongside the Professor. 

\NP The applications of this SOP are for various types of plant samples. As long as samples can be homogenzied, this procedure for DNA extraction is applicable. 

\section{Summary of Method}

Soil samples are homogenized by mechanical treatment or collected in a manner that does not require additional treatment (i.e. samples suspended in water/solvent). 

%The DNA is then extracted with Lysis Buffers PL1 or PL2 containing chaotropic salts, denaturing agents, and detergents, which are used to break open cells and cell membrane structures so the DNA can be isolated. RNase A is included to remove RNA and allow photometric quantification of pure genomic DNA. Crude lysates from the samples are cleared by centrifugation and/or filtration using the Nucleospin Filters to remove polysacchardies, contaimanations, and residual cellular debris. The clear flow-through that passes through filtration is mixed with binding buffer PC to create conditions for optimal binding of DNA to the silica membrane. After loading this mixture into the spin column, contaminants (proteins, RNA, metabolites, other PCR inhibitors) are washed away using Wash Buffers PW1 and PW2. The genomic DNA is finally eluted with low salt Elution Buffer PE or nuclease-free water to wash away unbound proteins.

\section{Acknowledgements}

\NP This SOP was originally written by Aparna... to extract DNA from surface waters. Initial test of the methods were done by Alejandro Guerrero in the summer of 2016. 

\section{Definitions}

\NP Term1: is... All reagants and equipment are self explanatory in lab. 

\section{Biases and Interferences}

\NP The extraction process is supposed to isolate DNA from other celluular or other organic materials. However, proteins and phenols...  

\NP When meausuring the DNA yield, these compounds may interfere with the measurements and thus, suggest you have more DNA that was extracted in reality. 

\NP Mesuring the absorbance ratios of several wavelength gives a reasonble estimate of DNA purity. See the QA/QC section to measure these contaminants.

\begin{description}
  \item[A260/A280 Ratio] Nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, absorb at 260nm. For a pure sample, a well defined peak (no shoulders or wiggles) at 260nm is expected.Several factors, however, can influence the accuracy of the 260/280 and 260/230 ratios. Readings from very dilute samples will have very little difference between the absorbance at 260 and 280nm leading to inaccurate ratios.  The type(s) of protein present will also have an effect.  Absorbance in the UV range by proteins is primarily the result of aromatic ring structures. Phenol and other contaminants can also absorb at 280 nm and can affect the ratio calculation. Phenol absorbs with a peak at 270nm. \textbf{Nucleic acid preparations uncontaminated by phenol should have an 260/280 ratio of around 1.8. } The pH of the solution can also affect the 260/280 ratio, with acidic solutions having a lower ratio of up to 0.2â€“0.3 and alkaline solutions having an increased ratio by a similar amount.
  \item[A260/A230 Ratio] Pure RNA has an A260/A280 ratio of 2.0, therefore if a DNA sample has an 260/280 ratio of greater than 1.8 this could suggest RNA contamination. The 260/280 ratio is a secondary measure of nucleic acid purity. This ratio for pure samples are often higher than the respective 260/280 ratio values. Strong absorbance around 230nm can indicate that organic compounds or chaotropic salts are present in the purified DNA.  A ratio of 260nm to 230nm can help evaluate the level of salt carryover in the purified DNA. The lower the ratio, the greater the amount of salt present. A\textbf{s a guideline, the 260/230 ratio should be greater than 1.5, ideally close to 1.8. } Urea, EDTA, carbohydrates and phenolate ions all have absorbance near 230nm. A reading at 320nm will indicate if there is turbidity in the solution, another indication of possible contamination.

\section{Health and Safety}

\NP The risks involved with using this kit are mainly related to the chemicals that are in use. As listed below, safety precautions should be taken at all times, but especially when handling hazardous reagants. While following safety protocol, it is advised that the materials and equipment are kept organized to avoid contamination and thus yield good results. 


\subsection {Safety and Personnnel Protective Equipment}

Always wear appropriate lab safety equipment, including safety goggles, lab coat, close-toed shoes, long pants, and gloves. 
CAUTION: PC and PW1 contain guanidine hydrochloride, ethanol, and isopropanol, beware of these chemicals coming into contact with the skin and especially the eyes. Also keep away from heat (highly flammable liquid and vapours)
