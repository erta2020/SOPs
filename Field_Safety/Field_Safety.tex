\section{Procedure}

\NP Field Safety

Allergies:

All allergies must be recorded in medical files before start of lab. Students with life threatening allergies must bring their Epi-pen to field station and keep it accessible at all times. In addition, backup epinephrine must be present in the first aid kits. Along with diphenhydramine and prednisone. 

In the case of a mild allergic reaction, 25-50mg of Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) should be administered. 

In the case of a severe allergic reaction - defined as swelling of the face/throat and respiratory distress - 0.3mg of Epinephrine must be administered. Such dosage can be re-administered after 5 minutes. Dosage should be followed by 25-50mg of Diphenhydramine and 20-40mg of Prednisone. Then EVAC from field station. 

2. Abiotic Hazards:
In the field, we are likely to encounter abiotic hazards such as extreme temperature, pollution, sharp objects, possibly dangerous equipment, etc. We will be working outside in Southern California in the fall, and therefore are at risk of overheating, heat stroke, dehydration, and sunburn. There’s also the potential risk during days with especially poor air quality. In such a dry climate, it is easy to underestimate the strength of the sun and thus the rate at which we may become dehydrated or burnt.  On the other end of the spectrum, less frequent environmental events such as thunderstorms bring risk of lightning strikes, which cause harm to people directly or indirectly through forest fires (e.g. the fire last year at Bernard Field Station, across the street from Pitzer’s campus, has made this risk particularly relevant.)

Hot days and forest fires can both lead to another abiotic risk that is easier to overlook - pollution. Working outside when the ozone levels or levels of other pollutants are too high has a detrimental effect on the health of anyone, but the impact of air pollution on health is most acute in people that already suffer from asthma.A string of hot, dry days worsen the pollution levels, while forest fires nearby degrade the air quality. Thus, students with any respiratory disease that may subject them to higher risks due to pollution should be cautious and report said condition to their instructor or laboratory supervisor. 

Additionally, we will also have to be careful of material left over from construction (e.g. working in the pit up at Pitzer.) Sharp metallic objects bring risk of injury and expose us to long-term illnesses like tetanus. Students should be aware of their vaccination history as well as how to proceed should they require a new tetanus shot due to injury.

Check radar. Know risks of area you are in.
Altitude Illness (HAPE/HACE)



Mountains, specifically high altitudes to which students have not had time to adjust properly
Less Oxygen in atmosphere
If persistent vomiting and severe headache- evacuate(go down to lower altitude)! If mild symptoms, acclimate, take it easy. Hydrate.
Identify symptoms (headache, nausea, and irritability) early
Earthquake
Anywhere in CA (West Coast is a subduction zone)
Tectonic plate movement
Stay away from external building frames, avoid sinkholes, gas lines, and utility wires.
Be aware of surroundings. If an earthquake happens, remain low to the ground.
Flood
Near bodies of water (e.g. riverine ecosystems)
Excessive rainfall
Find the highest point in the area and go to it. Try not to cross rushing water.
Be aware of surroundings. Check the forecast for rainfall.
Exposure to toxic waste
Unpredictable: We are exposed to it via ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure.
Illegal (most likely) dumping of toxic waste, unless it’s arrived there via. water/wind/erosion.
Avoid and report.
Be aware of surroundings, think before interacting with unusual objects.

3. Biotic Hazards:

The field is home to a vast diversity of organisms. Being respectful of their environment is crucial to their safety and our own.

In general, we should be aware of biotic hazards such as poisonous plants, poisonous critters, and wild animals. This semester, we will be working primarily at the Farm, the Pit, the Quad, and the Bernard Field Station, where hazards include mosquitos, rodents, mountain lions, snakes, spiders, bees, wasps, fleas and ticks, poison oak, and stinging nettle.

Hazard
Location
Risk
If Encountered
Prevention
Mosquitos
Near stagnant water
Malaria
See diseases: malaria
Bug spray
Don’t make standing pools of water
Rodents
Debris, dense underbrush and burrow holes
Disease, infection
If bitten, clean and disinfect.
Don’t touch rodents
Mountain lions
Native to North/South America
Severe injury
Make yourself look larger, don’t run away, throw rocks or sticks
Avoid being alone 
Snakes
Rattlesnakes, cottonmouth, 
Snakebite
Back away slowly, no sudden movements
If bitten, seek immediate medical attention for antivenom
Walk in open areas, wear heavy boots, listen for rattle.
Spiders
Black widow, brown recluse
Spider bite, nausea, 
Go to hospital if bitten
Wear gloves while working in field, shake out clothing and bedding, avoid places of residence

\subsection{Bees \& Wasps}

Bees, wasps, yellowjackets, hornets, Africanized honey bees
Swelling in affected area, pain, allergic reaction, anaphylactic shock
Administer epidural (requires certification) if person stung has severe allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock, take to hospital immediately. For less severe reactions, administer antihistamine. Ice.
Avoid disturbing bees, stay calm when pursued. If allergic carry epidural at all times, have others know where it is.

\subsection{Fleas \& Ticks}

Underbrush, wooded areas.
See Lyme disease
Suffocate tick with vaseline before removing from skin with tweezers/credit card.
Tick check after being in suspected regions, insect repellent, wear long clothing
Poison Oak
Riparian habitats

Itchy rash
Red, swollen skin
Apply Tecnu, wash affected areas with dish soap, avoid spreading contact
Learn to identify, Tecnu beforehand
Stinging Nettle
Riparian habitats, meadows

Stinging sensation
Stinging sensation generally lessens over time, if not, anti-itch cream.
Learn to identify


4. Other Illness/Injury


Fracture/Break:
Refer to table for abiotic hazards for information on causes/location, prevention, and quick instructions on how to react. Stabilize injured part and try to avoid movements. Go to nearest medical facility for further care.
Injury from handling equipment(e.g cuts, burns):
Refer to table for abiotic hazards for information on causes/location, prevention, and quick instructions on how to react. Most importantly, handle all equipment with caution. Carefully read operating procedures. Seek help from fellow students or your instructor, should you have questions or doubts. Do not use any equipment if you are unsure of how to handle it. 
Epilepsy/Diabetes/Heart Failure:
Refer to emergency procedure(SOP, procedure 2).
Report any chronic conditions to your supervisor.
Be aware of your surroundings and be prepared to react in an emergency.
